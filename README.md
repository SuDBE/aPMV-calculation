# aPMV-calculation
An improved method for calculating aPMV index

Folder Input includes a cleaned dataset based on the Boxplot rule. Data were extracted from the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II: Parkinson, Thomas et al. (2022). ASHRAE global database of thermal comfort field measurements [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.6078/D1F671.

The PMV calculation can be done by using package pythermalcomfort, which is developed by: Tartarini, F., Schiavon, S., 2020. pythermalcomfort: A Python package for thermal comfort research. SoftwareX 12, 100578. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100578
